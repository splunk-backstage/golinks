## Advance searching
By default, search will search on the *keyword*, *Long URL*, *title* and *owner*.  When you are seeing too many results, you can narrow down your search to only one of these field

1. Let's say you want to find only the short keyword with the word **splunk**
2. Click on the *search by* drop down
3. Clear All
4. Select *Keyword*
5. Type `splunk` in the search field
